## University of New South Wales Beamer Theme

A Latex beamer theme for [University of New South Wales](https://www.unsw.edu.au/).
Design was based on the [Saarland beamer template](\href{https://github.com/kailashbuki/beamerthemesaarland}) and the guidelines listed in the [UNSW Visual Guide](https://www.brand.unsw.edu.au/download/).

## Basic Tutorial

* See `slides.tex`.
* Check out `slides.pdf` for a sample output.
* Personally, I used Tex Studio in compiling this Latex Beamer code.

## Advanced Notes

* Check out `advance\main.tex` and `advance\main.pdf` for a more complicated example. I won't be including the figures though so you won't be able to rebuild it.
* If you want to use Beamer with presenter view (like Microsoft PPT), check out [Dual Screen PDF viewer for latex beamer](https://github.com/dannyedel/dspdfviewer) and its [installation procedure](http://dspdfviewer.danny-edel.de/#how-do-i-install-it).
